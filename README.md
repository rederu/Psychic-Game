Javascript Homework for Coding Bootcamp

<h3>How does this work?</h3>

Basically this is a Javascript code that randomly picks a letter and the user has to guess which one is the letter chosen. The user has 10 attempts to guess the letter correctly. If  the user guesses it before it runs out of attempts, the victory is added to the number of wins. If the user could not guess the letter before it runs out of attempts, the loss is added to the number of losses.

The user just need to press any letter on the keyboard to guess. The code will make sure if the user guess is right or wrong. When the user runs out of attempts it just needs to press any key from the keyboard to try again.
